                " Here at Social Sewing we want to create an interative space where our members can. learn and create in
                a
                lively environment.
                I have met many individuals who would love to learnt he bas ic skills of sewing as a life social skill
                but
                dont know where to turn for a personable experience;
                so it led me to form this studio space for all who desire to learn. practice and create can do so, with
                others members close by and have the support they require."

                "I love knowing that we have a space in town for creatives of all levels to come togtehr. not only is
                this
                studio spacious, and the perfect environment to create
                but it is also a hub of community, a platform to network and build genuine connections. I came across
                the
                studio when I was searching for a space to pattern cut away from
                small single room and three years later i am so glad i dropped Susan that private message on Facebook!.
                I
                can not only work freely, but i get to help others to learn this great skill."

                "Social Sewing became my Second Home three years ago, straight out of grad school- UAL ; and i have
                loved
                everyday since. not only do I get to share my knowledge and love for fashion design
                but i get to see others fall in love with it too. People dont just come to learn, but they come to find
                a
                second home, just like i did. i am so glad we ar Sewing School and creating spaces for
